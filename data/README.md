# tender-buttons
Digital Exploration of Gertrude Stein's Tender Buttons against sensorimotor norms.[^1]

Key Research Questions:
- How does Stein use sensorimotor language?
- Does Stein use expected language or senses for the things she describes?

Methodology:
- Generating unique word list from Tender Buttons.
- Retrieving sensorimotor norm data (means, exclusivity, and dominant info) for unique word list.
- [TBD] Compiling data into interactive reading application.
- Reading and interpreting data.
  - Dominant sensorimotor norm for title of Object/Food (this is the 'control' or expectation) compared against the sensorimotor norms in descriptions.
